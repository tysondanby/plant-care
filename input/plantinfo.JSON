    "Info":"Aeonium 'Zwartkop', also known as Black Rose or Black Aeonium, is a striking succulent native to the Canary Islands. It is prized for its dramatic, dark burgundy to near-black rosettes that form on tall, bare stems. This cultivar thrives in Mediterranean climates and prefers full sun to develop its rich coloration, though it benefits from some afternoon shade in very hot regions. Aeonium 'Zwartkop' is winter-growing and may go semi-dormant during hot, dry summers, dropping some lower leaves. It prefers well-draining soil, moderate watering, and mild temperatures, avoiding frost. Its bold form makes it popular in xeriscaping and container arrangements.",

It prefers a slightly acidic to neutral pH and benefits from regular pinching to promote bushy growth and prevent flowering, which can reduce leaf flavor.

    "Info": "Key Lime (Citrus aurantiifolia) is a small, tropical citrus tree native to Southeast Asia and widely grown for its aromatic, tart fruits. It typically grows to 3–6 feet (1–2 meters) tall and is known for its glossy, dark green leaves and white flowers that bloom in clusters. Key lime trees thrive in warm climates and prefer well-draining, slightly acidic soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5. These trees require full sunlight for at least 8 hours a day to produce the best fruit. Ideal temperatures range from 65°F to 85°F (18°C–29°C), and they are sensitive to cold. Key lime trees require regular watering, with the soil kept moderately moist, but they do not tolerate overwatering. Moderate humidity levels and a balanced, citrus-specific fertilizer encourage optimal growth. While they can be grown in pots, they benefit from ample space to spread their roots. Key lime trees typically produce fruit that is green when immature, turning yellow-green as they ripen.",

    "Info": "Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) is a hardy, evergreen herb native to the Mediterranean region, valued for its aromatic leaves and versatile culinary uses. Rosemary can grow as a bushy shrub or smaller plant, reaching heights of 3–6 feet (1–2 meters). It thrives in well-draining, slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0, and prefers full sunlight for at least 6–8 hours per day. Rosemary grows best in moderate temperatures, ideally between 60°F to 75°F (15°C–24°C), and it is drought-tolerant once established. It is relatively low-maintenance, requiring infrequent watering, allowing the top 1–2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. It prefers low humidity and benefits from occasional light fertilization. This herb is also resistant to pests and can be used in culinary dishes, as well as in aromatherapy or for ornamental purposes. Rosemary's fragrant, needle-like leaves have a strong, pine-like aroma and can be harvested year-round.",
